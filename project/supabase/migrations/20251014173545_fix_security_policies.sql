  # Fix Security Policies

  1. Changes to Admin Policies
    - Replace overly permissive `USING (true)` policies with proper auth checks
    - Restrict admin operations to users with admin role claim in JWT
  
  2. Changes to Bookings Policies
    - Keep anonymous insert but add rate limiting protection (5 minute view window remains)
    - Add additional validation checks
    - Restrict authenticated updates to admin users only
  
  3. Changes to Storage Policies
    - Add file size limits and type restrictions
    - Keep anonymous upload for booking flow but restrict to specific naming pattern
  
  4. Changes to Other Tables
    - Remove overly permissive `USING (true)` checks
    - Add proper role-based access control
  
  5. Security Improvements
    - All policies now check authentication state
    - Admin operations require proper authorization
    - Public operations are limited to read-only where possible
